UCL MotionInput v3.2 - Child's Play

This is a pseudo-VR based application developed by UCL. It allows the user to map their gestures and movements to keypresses.
This file contains a general description of the application, providing an overview of its controls and settings.
There are eight modes in this build, which can be selected by choosing from three binary options:
-	Seated or Standing
-	Left or Right hand
-	2D or 3D
By selecting any combination of these options, you can define how the MotionInput application will behave

==================================MODES==================================
Standing or Seated:
Standing – Mode for active gameplay, which encompasses walking, jumping, and hand gestures.
Seated – For users who are not cannot/do not want to perform activities requiring standing. This mode changes the mapping of several hit triggers, so that they work for seated users.
This translates to the jump trigger no longer mapping on nose but on hand and one new button existing for walking forward.
----------------
2D or 3D:
2D – This mode starts with 3 triggers (Left, Right, Jump) and serves for 2D games.
3D - This mode starts with 5 triggers (Left, Right, Up, Down, Jump) and serves for 2D games.
----------------
Left or Right:
Trigger positions will adjust depending on your dominant hand (either Left or Right).
====================================================================

There are also other setting available, which allow for further customization of the MotionInput gameplay.

==================================SETTINGS==================================
Extra buttons (0-3):
This allows you to add 1-3 extra triggers (x, y, z), which will be also positioned during calibration.
----------------
Jump height (1-5):
Allows you to determine how far should the jump trigger be placed during calibration and thus determine how high do you want to jump.
----------------
Walk sensitivity (1-5):
Determines how many in-game steps map to one step in a real life, with higher number meaning more in-game steps.
----------------
Speech (on/off):
Turn this on if you want the option to control the game through voice commands. Once activated, you can use all the voice commands during gameplay.
The list of voice commands is as follows:
“Run” - Triggers right arrow until “Stop”
“Back” - Triggers left arrow until “Stop”
“Stop” - Releases right and left arrow keys
“Jump” - Triggers space key press
“Menu” - Triggers enter key
====================================================================

Once you have set up all these details, press "Launch" to save the settings and start the calibration process.
During this process, you will have the opportunity to place all the triggers in a location that works for you by following the instructions on the screen.
